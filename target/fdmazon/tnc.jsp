				transactions that are carried out on the FDMazon Marketplace,
				FDMazon is neither the buyer nor the seller of the seller's items.
				FDMazon provides a venue for sellers and buyers to negotiate and
				complete transactions. Accordingly, the contract formed at the
				completion of a sale for these third party products is solely
				between buyer and seller. FDMazon is not a party to this contract
				nor assumes any responsibility arising out of or in connection with
				it nor is it the seller's agent. The seller is responsible for the
				sale of the products and for dealing with any buyer claims or any
				other issue arising out of or in connection with the contract
				between the buyer and seller. Because FDMazon wants the buyer to
				have a safer buying experience, FDMazon provides the in addition to

				We will do our utmost to ensure that availability of the FDMazon

				be guaranteed. Also, your access to FDMazon Services may also be
				occasionally suspended or restricted to allow for repairs,
				maintenance, or the introduction of new facilities or services. We
				will attempt to limit the frequency and duration of any such
				suspension or restriction. FDMazon will not be responsible for (i)
				losses that were not caused by any breach on our part, or (ii) any
				business loss (including loss of profits, revenue, contracts,
				anticipated savings, data, goodwill or wasted expenditure), or (iii)
				any indirect or consequential losses that were not foreseeable to
				both you and us when you commenced using the FDMazon Services. We
				will not be held responsible for any delay or failure to comply with
				our obligations under these conditions if the delay or failure
				arises from any cause which is beyond our reasonable control. This
				condition does not affect your legal right to have goods sent or
				services provided within a reasonable time or to receive a refund if
				goods or services ordered cannot be supplied within a reasonable
				time owing to a cause beyond our reasonable control. The laws of
				some countries do not allow some or all of the limitations described
				above. If these laws apply to you, some or all of the above
				limitations may not apply to you and you might have additional
				rights. Nothing in these conditions limits or excludes our
				responsibility for fraudulent representations made by us or for
				death or personal injury caused by our negligence or wilful
				misconduct.
				<h5>14. APPLICABLE LAW</h5>
				These conditions are governed by and construed in accordance with
				the laws of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, and the application of
				the United Nations Convention of Contracts for the International
				Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. We both agree to submit to the
				non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the district of
				Luxembourg City, which means that you may bring a claim to enforce
				your consumer protection rights in connection with these Conditions
				of Use in Luxembourg or in the EU country in which you live. The
				European Commission provides for an online dispute resolution
				platform, which you can access here. If you would like to bring a
				matter to our attention, please contact us.

					OF USE</h5>
				We reserve the right to make changes to any FDMazon Services,
				policies, terms and conditions including these Conditions of Use,
				and Service Terms at any time. You will be subject to the terms and
				conditions, policies and Conditions of Use in force at the time that
				you use the FDMazon Services. If any of these Conditions of Use is
				deemed invalid, void, or for any reason unenforceable, that
				condition will be deemed severable and will not affect the validity
				and enforceability of any remaining condition.
				<h5>16. WAIVER</h5>
				If you breach these Conditions of Use and we take no action, we will
				still be entitled to use our rights and remedies in any other
				situation where you breach these Conditions of Use.
